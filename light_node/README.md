Light Node
===========

This is an implementation of a lightweight Tezos node written in Rust.

# Running the node
Detailed information on how to start the node can be found in the repository [README](../README.md) file

## Arguments

All arguments and their default values can be found in the [tezedge.config](./etc/tezedge/tezedge.config) file.
They can also be provided as command line arguments in the same format, in which case they have higher priority than the ones in config file

### Tezos context storage

The context storage to use. Options are:

- `irmin`: uses the default Irmin context implementation.
- `tezedge`: uses TezEdge's own context implementation.
- `both`: uses both Irmin and TezEdge contexts.

```
--tezos-context-storage <NAME>
```


### Tezos data dir
The path to directory which will be used to store Tezos-specific data. This is a required argument, and if the node fails to
create or access this directory, it will die gracefully.

```
--tezos-data-dir <PATH>
```

### Identity file
The path to the json identity file with peer-id, public-key, secret-key and pow-stamp.
If an identity does not exist in the specified path, a new one will be automatically generated.
In case it starts with "./" or "../", it is a relative path to the current dir, otherwise to the --tezos-data-dir

```
--identity-file <PATH>
```

## Database configuration
### Bootstrap database path
Path to the bootstrap database directory.
In case it starts with "./" or "../", it is a relative path to the current dir, otherwise to the --tezos-data-dir.
If the directory does not exist, it will be created. If directory already exists and
it contains a valid database, the node will continue in the bootstrapping process on that database

```
--bootstrap-db-path <PATH>
```

### (Optional) parameters
```
#Max number of threads used by database configuration. If not specified, then number of threads will be equal to number of CPU cores.
--db-cfg-max-threads <NUM>
```

-----

### Bootstrap lookup addresses
List of peers to bootstrap the network from. Peers are delimited by a colon.
For further information, see `--network` parameter of the OCaml node.

```
--bootstrap-lookup-address <ADRRESS>(,<ADDRESS>)*
```

### Logging file
Path to the logger file. If provided, logs are written to the log file, otherwise they will be displayed in the terminal.
In case it starts with "./" or "../", it is a relative path to the current dir, otherwise to the --tezos-data-dir
```
--log-file <PATH>
```

### Logging format
Set format of logger entries, used usually with `--logger-format` argument.
Possible values are either `simple` or `json`.
Simple format is a human-readable format while JSON produces structured, easily machine-consumable log entries.

```
--log-format <LOG-FORMAT>
```

### Logging level
Set log level. Possible values are: `critical`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`
```
--log-level <LEVEL>
```

### OCaml logging
Enable OCaml runtime logger.

```
--ocaml-log-enabled <BOOL>
```

### Network
Specifies the Tezos environment for this node. Accepted values are:
`alphanet, babylonnet, babylon, mainnet, zeronet, carthagenet, carthage, delphinet, delphi, edonet (deprecated - use edo2), edo (deprecated - use edo2), edo2net, edo2, sandbox, florencenet, florence`

```
--network <NETWORK>
```

There is an additional special value accepted for specifying a custom network setup: `custom`.

When `--network custom` is used, an extra argument needs to be specified:

```
--custom-network-file <PATH>
```

The format of the file should match the format used by Octez to specify a custom network.

Example:

```json
{
  "network": {
    "chain_name": "CUSTOM_NETWORK",
    "genesis": {
      "block": "BLockGenesisGenesis....snip",
      "protocol": "PtYuensgYBb3G3x....snip",
      "timestamp": "2018-06-30T16:07:32Z"
    },
    "sandboxed_chain_name": "SANDBOXED_TEZOS",
    "default_bootstrap_peers": [],
    "genesis_parameters": {
      "values": {
        "genesis_pubkey": "edpkuJQjux....snip"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### P2P Port
Specifies port for peer to peer communication.

```
--p2p-port <PORT>
```

### RPC port
The node contains a subset of the Tezos node's REST API as described in further sections. This argument specifies the port on which
those APIs will be available.

```
--rpc-port <PORT>
```

### WebSocket Access Address
The node exposes various metrics and statistics in real-time through a websocket. This argument specifies the address at which this websocket will be accessible.

```
--websocket-address <IP:PORT>
```

### Peers <optional>
Allowed network peers to bootstrap from. This argument is good to use in a controlled testing environmnet.
Each peer is described by its address and port in `IP:PORT` format, delimited by a colon.

```
--peers <IP:PORT>(,<IP:PORT>)*
```

### Lower peer threshold
Set minimal number of peers, if the running node does not have enough connected peers, peer discovery is enforced.

```
-peer-thresh-low <NUMBER>
```

### Higher peer threshold
Set maximum number of connected peers. If this threshold is met, then the running node will not try to connect to any more peers.

```
--peer-thresh-high <NUMBER>
```

### Protocol runner
Path to the protocol runner binary, which is compiled with `tezedge`.
For example: `./target/debug/protocol-runner`.

```
--protocol-runner <PATH>
```

### Bootstrap DNS lookup
Disables DNS lookup to get peers to bootstrap from the network. Default: false
```
--disable-bootstrap-lookup
```
### Mempool
Enable or disable mempool.
```
--disable-mempool
```

### Private node mode
Enable or disable the private node. Use peers to set the IP addresses of the peers you want to connect to.
```
--private-node
```

### Test chain
Flag for enable/disable test chain switching for block applying. Default: false
```
--enable-testchain <BOOL>
```

### Context stats DB
Path to the database where the context stats will be stored. If not specified, stats will not be produced.
```
--context-stats-db-path <PATH>
```

### Sandbox context patching
Path to the json file with key-values which will be added to the empty context on startup and commit genesis.
```
--sandbox-patch-context-json-file <PATH>
```

## Subcommands

The following subcommands are supported.

### Snapshot

`snapshot` is used to take a snapshot of the current storage to produce a trimmed copy which contains all block headers and operations up until the specified target block, and also its associated context revision. It doesn't include results for older blocks, or older reversions of the context.

The node can continue processing newer blocks when using this snapshot, but will not be able to serve RPC calls that depend on older data.

In addition to the command-line arguments described above, it also supports the following arguments:

- `--target-path <PATH>`: The directory on which to create the snapshot.
- `--block <BLOCK-HASH>`: Target block (defaults to the hash of `HEAD~10`). Also accepts a level or a negative offset from the current HEAD (for example: `--block ~8096`). *(optional)*

**Example:**

The following command will create a snapshot for `HEAD~10` (the default) on `/tmp/tezedge-storage-snapshot`. The node can then be use this trimmed copy with `--tezos-data-dir=/tmp/tezedge-storage-snapshot`.

```
cargo run --bin \
    light-node snapshot \
        --config-file ./light_node/etc/tezedge/tezedge.config \
        --tezos-data-dir=/tmp/original-data \
        --target-path=/tmp/tezedge-storage-snapshot
```

### Replay

`replay` is used to replay the application of a range of blocks.

In addition to the command-line arguments described above, it also supports the following arguments:

- `--from-block <BLOCK-HASH>`: Block from which we start the replay. *(optional)*
- `--to-block <BLOCK-HASH>`: Replay until this block. After it is reached, the replayer stops.
- `--target-path <PATH>`: A directory for the replay. The resulting database will be saved to this directory.
- `--fail-above <MILLIS>`: Panic if the block application took longer than this number of milliseconds. *(optional)*

**Example:**

The following command will run the replayer on the database found in `/tmp/original-data`,
re-applying all bocks until `BMf2TQSuyJrsE7JQjEBj1ztfspoVaFChEmVg6DsUYHxinsEVEeW`
for the `edo2net` network, and produce a new database in `/tmp/replay-result`. If any of the blocks takes longer than 1000 milliseconds to be applied, the process will be aborted.

```
cargo run --bin \
    light-node replay \
        --config-file ./light_node/etc/tezedge/tezedge.config \
        --tezos-data-dir=/tmp/original-data
        --target-path=/tmp/replay \
        --network=edo2net \
        --to-block BMf2TQSuyJrsE7JQjEBj1ztfspoVaFChEmVg6DsUYHxinsEVEeW \
        --fail-above 1000
```
