// TODO: there should be difference between 2 kinds of proposals. 1 is
// normal one, which is meant to be recorded and if replayed will give
// us exact same state. and 2nd is like this one, which is purely just
// for performance reasons. Since we invoke read on reader which makes a
// syscall to read certain bytes means that those bytes aren't available
// and are consumed on read, hence hard to debug. So these types of proposals
// should simply invoke another proposal like in this case that the chunk
// is ready so that proposal can be recorded and replayed.
